# TestAssignment7tam
________________________________________________________________
TestAssignment7tam is a test assignment I did for a job interview in around 3 days. It's a 2D top-down shooter that uses Unity's _Netcode for GameObjects_, _Relay_ and _Lobby_ packages as the network stack, providing a seamless multiplayer experience for Andorid devices.
